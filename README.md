# PDE-IF-Estimation-MulticomponentSignals
This project introduces an enhanced instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation method designed for mode crossing and spectral aliasing conditions. By optimizing spectrogram gradients, adaptive frequency point selection, and multi-scale regularization, the method ensures robust IF trajectory estimation
