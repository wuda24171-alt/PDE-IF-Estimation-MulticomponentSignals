# PDE-IF-Estimation-MulticomponentSignals
(Partial Differential Equation-Based Instantaneous Frequency Estimation for Multicomponent Signals)

## Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the PDE-based instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation method described in our paper *[ A Partial Differential Equation-Based Method for Instantaneous Frequency Curves Estimation of Multicomponent Signals in the Timeâ€“Frequency Spectrogram]*.  
The method is designed to estimate instantaneous frequency for multi-component signals under **mode-crossing** and **spectral-mixing** conditions. By optimizing spectrogram gradients, adaptive frequency point selection, and multi-scale regularization, the method ensures robust IF trajectory estimation.
